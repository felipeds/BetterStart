# Better Start

This is a fan-made, experimental mod for the game [The Long Dark](http://hinterlandgames.com/).

The goal of this mod is to enable you to add new items to your starting inventory, allowing for grater customization of the experience.

### Disclaimer

* **DO NOT** report bugs to Hinterland Studios if you use this mod; any bug you encounter may be due to the mod.

* This is completely fan-made and I have **no affiliation** with Hinterland Studios whatsoever.

* This mod is **experimental**; it should work but there is no guarantee it won't screw up your save somehow (though corrupting a save is highly unlikely). It's also very rough in terms of use (you need to edit an XML file).

### How to install

* Install [zeobviouslyfakeacc's](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc) awesome [Mod Loader for TLD](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller).

* The mod loader will create a directory 'mods' at the root of your game directory; it will also add a first mod: AddModdedToVersionString.dll. Leave it; it will make sure your game appears as loaded in the main menu.

* Move the BetterStart.dll file into this 'mods' directory.

* Move the BetterStart.xml file into your game root directory (that is, the directory that contains the "mods" folder).

* Tweak the values in BetterStart.xml as you wish (instructions bellow).

* The next time you start the game, those values should be taken into account.

### How to use

### How to uninstall

To uninstall the mod, simply remove the .dll file from the mods/ folder.

If you want to completely remove modding capabilities from your game, use [zeobviouslyfakeacc's Mod Loader for TLD](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) again; you can disable the mod loading patch from the tool.
